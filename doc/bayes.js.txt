bayesNode: An object representing a variable in a bayesian network:

Properties(user settable): 
    children: The children of the node/

    CPT: Conditional probobility table

    domain: Values. Currently only supports boolean variables.

    observation: Value of the varible. Use "none" if it is a hidden variable.

    Parents: The parent's of the node.

Methods:

    P(evidence, value)
        get probobility of value based on evidence. Evidence must be complete over the CPT.

    Sample(evidence)
        Sample a variable from CPT. Evidence must be complete over the CPT.

BayesNet: An object containg a collection of bayesNodes, representing a full bayesian network and their
conditional probobility distributions. 

Properties: 

    variables: a collection of varibles in the network.
    numVars: number of variables in the network.


Methods:

    addVar(name,obj)
        adds variable name to the network with properties from obj.

    rmVar(name)
        removes variable name from network.

    addRelationship(p, child)
        adds relationship of the form "p is parent of child"
    
    rmRelationship(p, child)
        removes relationship of the form "p is parent of child"


Exact Inferencing methods:

    enumerationASK(query)
        Exact inference using enumeration. returns the distribution of the variable query.

Approximate Inferencing methods:

    rejectionASK(query, N)
    Returns approximate inference of query. N specifies the number of times to run the inferencing algorthim.

    liklihoodASK(query, N)
    Returns approximate inference of query. N specifies the number of times to run the inferencing algorthim.
MCMC Inferencing methods:

    gibbsASK(query, N) 
    Returns approximate inference of query. N specifies the number of times to run the inferencing algorthim.
